\begin{frame}{ Computer Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pipeline
\item Single Instruction Multiple Data
\item Memory Locality
\item Many cores
\item Complex Scheduling
\item Very Hard to Beat a Compiler for Low-Level Optimization\\
however programs have to be written in such way as to be amenable to optimization\\
Conditional statements, unpredictable memory access prohibit optimization.
\item Processors Are Powerful and Cheap\\
     Optimized for Games and Signal Processing, 4x4 matrix\\
     Underutilized often, 15 percent efficiency is common
\item  Efficient Implementations demand unrolling kernels

\item gaussian basis, $e ^{-r^2}$ separable in Cartesian coordinates
\item  Most Integral schemes use recursive nature of gaussian integration/differentiation
\item Numerical error - loss of significant figures, etc.\\
Recursion implies using a slightly incorrect value to compute next\\
Especially severe when two values are close in magnitude but different in sign (difference)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{   Integral  evaluation}

\begin{frame}{  Integral Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item C++ object-oriented library
\item Fortran And Gamess bindings
\item  Simple Interface:\\
Create quadrature object for given shell quartet\\
Call Object operator for a given center quartet
call object operator for a list of Center quartets

\item Two Internal Implementations:\\
  Fully Unrolled And Simplified kernels for smaller  integral, 
  which is likely to be contracted\\
  Partially Unrolled (bra only) general quadrature\\
\item Internals make heavy use of  C++ templates and automatically generated code
\item Human Serviceable Code is small - around 2000 lines of code
\item Final Library Size his small - around 5 megabytes fully optimized
\item the code is kept small due to objects and genetic templates

\begin{frame}{  Fock Matrix}
\begin{itemize}
\item $F = (ab |cd)D $

Call Object operator for a given center quartet\\
Call Object operator for a list of Center quartets

\item Basis Set organization and higher-level logic is handled by another library
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{  GPU implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementations are driven by integral size and contraction order
\item Large integrals are parallel over individual elements\\
every thread gets a unique internal element to compute
\item highly contracted small integrals are parallel over contractions\\
every thread gets the unique contraction to compute\\
contractions are  reduced in the end
\item Basis  must be ordered to guarantee execution of the kernel on multiple centers
\item Thanks to objects and genetic templates, the entire kernel code is about 300 lines

  still working on full optimization
\item GPU implementation not yet complete\\
